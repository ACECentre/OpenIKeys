2 - Product Notes

Installation Note: 
To install IntelliKeys USB software, you must have Administrator access for 
the computer. Before installing this new version, unplug the IntelliKeys 
USB from the computer.  Then uninstall the older IntelliKeys USB software.

To uninstall the older version:
- For Windows XP, use Add/Remove Programs from the Control Panel.
- For Windows 7 and 8, use Programs and Features.
- For Mac, use the Uninstall program provided with the installation.

If, however, you have the Popular Software Overlays, DO NOT uninstall the
older IntelliKeys USB software!

Very important information for Mac users!

- Version 3.5.2 will only work on Intel systems running Mac OS 10.5.8 - 10.8.
  This may be found in "Installers/V3.5 (10.x, Intel Only)" in the English 
  version of the product, and is the only installer version for international
  versions of the product. 

- On Mac OS X the IntelliKeys USB icon appears in the menu bar,
  typically next to the time display.  Select this icon 
  to open the IntelliKeys USB control panel. In Classic mode, 
  from the menu bar select the Finder to select the IntelliKeys 
  USB icon to open the IntelliKeys USB control panel. 

- The standard IntelliKeys USB overlays' mouse right click 
  key will work in Mac OS X programs that support the mouse 
  right click functionality.

- On Macs each attached keyboard is recognized as separate and 
  unique. This means that the num lock and caps lock lights on 
  the IntelliKeys USB will report the state for the IntelliKeys 
  USB only. These lights would not need to be synchronized with 
  the lights on the standard keyboard.
