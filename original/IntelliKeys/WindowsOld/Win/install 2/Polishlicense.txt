Usage: (a) Right to Install and Use - IK USB Purchaser: You may install and use the IKUSB software on any number of computers.  Single Purchaser: You may install and use one copy of the software on one computer. If you are part of an educational institution, single purchasers may install the software on up to two computers within the institutional site, but may only use one of them at any time.  Since permission to install the Software on a second computer is intended as a convenience to the licensed user rather than an extension of the License to additional users, Licensee may only use one (1) installation at a time. Concurrent use on two (2) or more computers is not authorized without the advance written consent of Intellitools and the payment of additional license fees. The software may not be installed on a network server or made accessible via public network. Network with Web License Purchaser: A Network with Web License gives the licensee the right to install copies of the software on any number of machines, as well as on one or multiple Local Area Network servers for maintenance of files, user preferences, and  reports or portfolios. However, the number of users simultaneously operating the software at a given time is strictly limited to the number of licenses purchased. All licenses will be maintained on servers hosted by Cambium Learning Technologies. Once you purchase the Network with Web License edition of Classroom Suite, your Network Administrator will receive one installation CD and one set of documentation. Your Network Administrator will have 30 calendar days to register each server with IntelliTools.  You will have the right to make as many copies of the documentation needed to support your teachers, or you can purchase the documentation directly from IntelliTools at the time of initial Network with Web License edition software purchase. (b) Right to Modify - All Purchasers: Software may not in any manner be disassembled, de-compiled, unlocked, or reverse translated. (c) Right to Transfer Single Purchaser: You may not sublicense, rent, lend, or lease the software beyond the terms of any agreement signed with the company. You may transfer your rights to another party along with this Software License Agreement, the software (including the most recent updates and all prior editions) and all accompanying written materials. The new owner assumes the rights and obligations outlined in this Agreement. As part of the transfer, you must destroy all copies of the software other than the original. Network with Web License Purchaser: You may not sublicense, rent, lend, or lease the software beyond the terms of any agreement signed with the company.

Upgrades.

A Software Package labeled as an upgrade replaces and/or supplements the product that formed the basis for your eligibility for the upgrade. You may use the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this License. If the Software Package is an upgrade of a component of a package of software programs that you licensed as a single product, the Software Package may be used and transferred only as a part of that single product package and may not be separated for use on more than one computer.

Network with Web License Purchaser: Initial Network with Web License Purchases follow the same policy as under Single Purchaser above.
