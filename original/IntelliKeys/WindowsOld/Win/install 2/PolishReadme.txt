1- What's changed in this version

Version 3.1 (does not apply to Mac OS 8.6 and 9.x):

-  The IntelliKeys USB 3.1 installer will not install on Mac 8.6 and 9.x. For Mac 
   OS 8.6 and 9.x, run the separate IntelliKeys USB version 1.0.4 installer found
   on the IntelliKeys USB CD. 

-  Minor changes to the Control Panel, System tray (Windows) and Menu Bar 
   (Macintosh) to simplify using the IntelliKeys with Discover setups: Renamed 
   the Contol Panel "Advanced Features" tab to "Mode", adding the Discover mode,  
   removed references to Discover and ClickIt! from the Applications tab.

-  Several programming changes for integration with Discover 2.0.2 and Envoy 1.0

-  Added the Mouse Directions switch preset: Mouse Up, Mouse Down, Mouse Left, 
   Mouse Right, Click.

-  Attached Popular Software Overlays for Inspiration 8, Clicker 5, AOL IM and some
   minor key content fixes.

-  Fixed a crash when attempting to launch the control panel via the Windows 
   Control Panels folder.

-  Known Windows Problems: 

   Discover Pro 2.0 disables ClickIt! Uninstall Discover Pro 2.0 to allow ClickIt! 
   to work.
  
   When IntelliKeys USB is installed after Discover Pro 2.0, you must restart 
   the computer for IntelliKeys USB to work. 

-  Known Macintosh Problems: 
   
   Macs with non standard hard drive names causes IntelliKeys USB to be
   non-functional. For example, no name, name with leading spaces, name with ..., 
   name with |, name with ", etc.

   In OS 9.x "IntelliKeys not found" false messages seen with Spider & 
   Friends Early Math. The overlay is actually working, as well 
   as the switches.

Very important information for Mac users!

-  Beginning with version 3.1, the installer will only work on systems running
   Mac OS 10.1 and higher.  Double-click the "IK USB Installer/Uninstaller" 
   icon on the CD to install or uninstall the IntelliKeys USB software on these
   systems.

   To use IntelliKeys on systems running OS 8.6 or 9.x, use the version 1.04
   installer found on the CD in the folder "IntelliKeysUSB Mac OS 8.6/9.x".  
   This folder is only available when the CD is used on a system running 
   OS 8.6 or 9.x.

   New features introduced in version 3, and the Popular Software Overlays,
   are NOT available on Mac OS 8.6 or 9.x

- On Mac OS X the IntelliKeys USB icon appears in the menu bar,
  typically next to the time display.  Select this icon 
  to open the IntelliKeys USB control panel. In Classic mode, 
  from the menu bar select the Finder to select the IntelliKeys 
  USB icon to open the IntelliKeys USB control panel. 

- On Mac OS 8.6 and 9.x, open the IntelliKeys USB control panel 
   from the Control Strip or from under the Apple, select Control Panels.

- The standard IntelliKeys USB overlays' mouse right click 
  key will work in Mac OS X programs that support the mouse 
  right click functionality.

- On Macs each attached keyboard is recognized as separate and 
  unique. This means that the num lock and caps lock lights on 
  the IntelliKeys USB will report the state for the IntelliKeys 
  USB only. These lights would not need to be synchronized with 
  the lights on the standard keyboard.  
 
- If you will always boot your computer under OS X, you only
  need to install the software once.  But if you plan to boot 
  your computer under OS 9, you will need to install the 
  IntelliKeys USB software again after you reboot in OS 9. 
  Starting with version 3.1, you will need to install the separate 
  IntelliKeys USB version 1.0.4 installer found
  on the IntelliKeys USB CD in a folder named "IntelliKeysUSB Mac OS 8.6/9.x". 
 
  This only needs to be done once.

- If you have a dual boot (OS9 and OS X) configuration, always
  unplug your IntelliKeys USB before booting a different OS.  If you  
  do not, the IntelliKeys will not function properly.  When you 
  reboot into the SAME OS, you should not need to unplug the IntelliKeys
  USB.

2 - Operating System Support 

IntelliKeys USB version will run on

   Mac OS 8.6, 9.x, 10.1 or higher
   Windows 98, 98 SE, Millennium(ME), 2000, and XP

It will not run on 

   Mac OS earlier than 8.6
   Mac OS 10.0
   Windows 95
   Windows NT 4.0

3 - Windows 2000/XP requires Administrator
    privileges to install/remove

To install or remove the software under Windows 2000 or Windows XP,
you must log in with Administrator privileges.  If you attempt to
install or remove the software without Administrator privileges,
you may get a message that reads "corrupt installation detected".
This is an indication that you do not have the correct privileges.


4- Windows users may need their original Windows
   installation CD

Installation may require some Windows components
that were not previously installed on your
computer.  You may be asked to supply them by
inserting your original Windows installation CD. If this CD 
(or CAB file) is not provided when prompted, IntelliKeys 
USB will not work.


5 - Critical Sleep requires reboot

If your PC goes into a critical sleep state such 
as in these circumstances:

   - low batteries, or  
   - attempt to standby with active dial-up connection,
     disk tool such as scandisk active, or while the low 
     battery warning message is displayed

then you may need to reboot your system to resume 
using IntelliKeys USB and/or your computer.


6 - IntelliKeys USB User's Guide Documentation clarifications: 

Documentation updated as of October 2005.


7 - Using IntelliKeys USB on a Macintosh 
    with Multiple Users (OS 9.x)

Currently, IntelliKeys USB only works fully for the person 
who installed it in a Multiple User configuration.  
This would be the computer's Owner which could be 
an organization's System Administrator.  The result 
is that when other users logon to the machine IntelliKeys 
USB may not be available. The reason is that each user 
has their own Startup Items folder.

There is a workaround for Limited Users, and that
is for the computer's Owner to:

   1 - put an alias for the IntelliKeys USB App into 
   each user's Startup Items folder
   a) Go to the System Folder and open the Startup 
      Items folder
   b) Duplicate the alias called "IntelliKeys USB App"
   c) Open the Users folder on the hard drive. Drag 
      this alias copy into the Startup Items folder 
      for each user. 

   2 - grant access to IntelliKeys USB for users 
       who need it.
   a) Open the Multiple Users control panel. 
   b) For each user, under the Applications tab, select 
      "IntelliKeys USB" (**Note: Do NOT select 
      "IntelliKeys USB App")

This workaround will allow the use of standard overlays,
but not custom overlays.

Panels Users are not supported in this version
of IntelliKeys USB.


8 - Restricted access (security protected) computers

IntelliKeys USB installs files in the locations detailed below. 
In addition, a temporary file may be created and modified in 
each user's operating system designated temporary folder, 
and files may be created and modified in the IntelliKeys 
USB Documents folder and Private folder 

   - Mac OS X

      Mac HD:Applications:IntelliTools:IntelliKeys USB:
      Mac HD:System:Library:Extensions:IKUSBMatch.kext

      Mac HD:System:Library:LaunchDaemons:com.intellitools.ikusb1.plist
      Mac HD:System:Library:LaunchDaemons:com.intellitools.ikusb2.plist

      If the Mac is configured to run in Classic:

      Mac HD:System Folder:Extensions:Switch InTT Release
      Mac HD:System Folder:Startup Items:IntelliKeys USB App shortcut

   - Mac OS 8.6 and 9.x

      c:\...\(user)temp\temp.omc


9 - Previous versions changes

Version 3.0.1 (does not apply to Mac OS 8.6 and 9.x):

-  Fixed an issue in version 3.0 where Opening Overlay Sender displays a false "IntelliKeys not found " message.

-  Improved support for using IntelliKeys USB and IntelliSwitch with DiscoverPro.

-  Support for a new "delay" feature in Overlay Maker 3.  You can now use [Delay nnn] 
in overlays to effect a pause.  The delay of "nnn" is in seconds.  For example, [Delay 2] 
would cause IntelliKeys USB to pause 2 seconds before typing the next content in the key.  
You must use Overlay Maker 3 (version 3.1 or greater) to use this feature.

-  Fixed an issue that prevented sending overlays from a CD on Mac OS X.

-  Fixed an issue where the menu bar icon is the wrong color on some Mac OS X systems.

-  If you use the Control Panel to choose the "use with this overlay" or "use as a switch"
advanced options, this is now reflected in the system tray (Windows) and menu bar (Macintosh).

-  Fixed a bug where [go to level xxx] appears in the middle of key content.

-  Eliminated an error message in the installer, about a missing function in SETUPAPI.DLL, 
seen on some Windows XP systems.

-  If you use the Control Panel to choose the "use as a switch"
advanced option, and you have both IntelliKeys USB and IntelliSwitch connected,
and you insert a standard overlay into IntelliKeys, IntelliKeys will observe the standard
overlay's switch settings, but IntelliSwitch will still observe the "use as a switch"
option.

Write:OutLoud, Inspiration, iTunes,Kidspiration, Kurzweil 3000, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, 
TestTalker, Wynn 3 and 4. 

-  Installation does not require restarting the computer and supports installing when
IntelliKeys USB is connected.  Also supports installing IntelliKeys USB driver software 
over previous versions without requiring an uninstall. 

-  The switch content for the standard overlays has been changed.  Now both switches
perform a mouse click.
    
-  Fixed Windows Problems: 
 
   Standard keyboard latency seen when starting the computer, in Microsoft Word and CO:Writer. 
   IntelliKeys overlay keys with multiple characters erratic typing seen in Microsoft Word and CO:Writer. 
   Double-clicking on omg and omc overlays did not send the overlay.

   non-functional. For example, no name, name with leading spaces, name with ..., 
   name with |, name with ", etc

version 2.0.4 (does not apply to Mac OS 8.6 and 9.x)

-  Fixed problems:

   Keys in group overlays did not type correctly after several
         level changes.
   The Shift key and other modifier keys were not working properly when 
         IntelliKeys was set to No Latching.

   Using the IntelliKeys USB Control Panel to choose an
         overlay using With This Overlay was failing on some 
         Windows computers.
   Switch settings #2 and #13 were not working on Windows computers.
   Overlays located other than on the user's primary hard drive
         would sometimes fail to type properly on Windows computers.
   
-  Fast User Switching for Windows XP is not yet supported. 
      Please uncheck "Use Fast User Switching" in the User Accounts 
      control panel. The selection of this feature is found by clicking 
      "Change the way users log on and off".

version 2.0.2 (does not apply to Mac OS 8.6 and 9.x)

-  Fixed problems:

   some G5 systems running OS X would crash after installing 
         the software.
   installing some older IntelliTools products after installing 
         IntelliKeys USB would cause overlay sending to fail.
   Right Alt and Left Alt keys were swapped
   Keyboard not always returned to level 1 when overlays 
         are switched or sent

  to switches. (The settings Data Send Rate, Repeat 
  Rate, Repeat on/off and Mouse Speed do apply to 
  switches)

- On Windows and OS X the Repeat Rate is set relative 
  to the operating system's keyboard repeat rate. Game 
  players using the IntelliKeys USB need to set the 
  IntelliKeys USB Repeat Rate to 15 (default)  

- On Windows supports JAWS keyboard echo and various DirectX games

- On Windows fixed Out of Memory when using IntelliKeys 
  USB Mouse Arrows in Word 2000

user's setting could get copied to another user in the same group.

- Fixed a problem where the control panel appeared distorted on
a Windows 2000 system at 800x600 resolution using large fonts.

- Fixed a problem where keys that contained mouse movements would
not work when repeating was turned off.

- Fixed a problem where keyboard input was not recognized by some
Windows games, HAL Screen Reader, and PowerTerm telnet application.

- Overlays for Printing PDF files are now the correct printable size.

- On Windows, the file "ikusb.dat" has been moved from C:\ to
C:\Itools\IntelliKeys USB\Private

version 1.0.3:

- Windows Logo warning message.  This message occurs after 
the IntelliKeys USB software is installed, and IntelliKeys 
USB is plugged in for the first time. When the New Hardware 
Wizard asks you to insert the hardware's disk/CD, click Next. 
When you see the message "IntelliKeys Firmware has not passed 
Windows Logo testing...", click Continue Anyway.  
Beginning with Windows XP, Microsoft is providing a higher 
level of warning when users install device drivers that have 
not been tested by Microsoft.  IntelliKeys USB uses a driver 
that has not yet been tested by Microsoft, but will be soon. 
You can safely choose to proceed with the installation as 
described above, and IntelliKeys USB will function properly.

- Fixes for false "IntelliKeys not found" message and 
"unknown flag" messages when sending an overlay on 
Windows computers.

- When using the control panel to choose an overlay to use 
with the "Use This Overlay" feature, you can now only select 
files that are valid overlay files.

- Fixed crashes and loss of overlay functionality when 
sending overlays with names longer than 27 characters. 
On Windows, using Overlay Maker version 1.06 or higher 
to save overlay files can prevent this long file name 
malady.

- Smart Typing Toggle now works the same way on Windows 
and Macintosh computers.

- On Windows, Command is translated to Alt when used 
with IntelliPics and IntelliPics Player. In any other 
application, Command will be translated to Control. 
Overlays to be used on Windows computers, may need to 
have the key content of Option or Command be changed 
to the correct Windows modifier Alt or Control.  

- Fixed NumberPad equals sign (=) and NumberPad Enter 
keys to work as intended.

- A Group overlay level is reset to level 1 when a) Keyboard 
Reset is performed, b) a different overlay is sent, 
and c) the user selects a different overlay using the 
"Use This Overlay" feature.

- Fixed the disabling of the Setup Overlay after sending 
a group overlay.

- Fixed errors where overlays did not work properly
on some systems using keyboard layouts from Canada and some
European countries.


version 1.0.2:

- An alternative to the Web Access Overlay for use with Netscape 6.2
for has been added to the Overlays for Editing folder.

- a bug was fixed on Windows where sending an overlay with a long 
name could cause the IntelliKeys to malfunction.

- Some key content errors in a few standard and alternative overlays
have been corrected.

- Changes to this document for the Macintosh Multiple Users feature
(see section 6)

- Documentation clarification: Page 29 of the IntelliKeys USB User's Guide
refers to the Number Pad feature of the QWERTY USB Overlay.  When the
the Number Pad feature is ON, then the F11 key on the overlay acts like "*" 
on a standard keyboard number pad, and F12 acts like "+".

- Windows: If you had a standard overlay in place, and you send an overlay
to IntelliKeys USB, you will see a message letting you know that you
should remove the standard overlay.  In some cases dismissing the message
could cause the overlay to be sent again, resulting in the same message,
repeating indefinitely.  This has been fixed.

- Macintosh: fixed a bug introduced in version 1.0.1 where choosing
"Use as a Switch" on the advanced tab of the control panel would not work.


version 1.0.1:

- More prominent feedback has been added to indicate whether the IntelliKeys 
USB On/Off switch is On or Off, and whether it is plugged into the computer. 
Visual readout of this now appears in the upper right of the control panel, 
and the taskbar / control strip icon will appear red if switched off or 
disconnected. Additionally, sending overlays while switched off will now 
result in red LEDs blinking on the IntelliKeys USB.

- For IntelliPics Windows and IntelliPics Player Windows, IntelliKeys USB will 
now translate "Command" to be "Alt" instead of "Control". This allows converted 
overlays (Macintosh to Windows) for use with IntelliPics and IntelliPics Player  
to 1) move to the next item and 2) repeat the item from the IntelliKeys USB 
switch ports. In any other Windows applications, IntelliKeys USB will translate 
"Command" to "Control".

- (Windows) Sleep/wake should now work properly, previously could crash on 
certain systems. 

- (Windows) Control panel launches and IntelliKeys USB works on certain 
systems such as Dell 4100 with Win Me, which previously could fail.

- Any Keyboard Settings specified for an overlay in Overlay Maker will now be 
observed, as would be expected. 

- Repeat and repeat latching operations are now "reset" as would be expected 
at certain times such as when changing overlays. Previously, repeats could be 
surprisingly reactivated after changing overlays, for instance.

- (Mac) Certain applications such as Living Books would not function normally 
with IntelliKeys USB running, but now should. For instance, if the Living 
Books window never maximized as normally, and got stuck on a particular 
screen, that is now fixed.

- (Windows) Clicking in or on the Control Panel's Advanced tab, when the 
Control Panel is not the foremost window, no longer causes the radio button 
selection for handling overlays to change incorrectly and unexpectedly.

- Clarification: When "Use with this overlay" or "Use as a switch with these 
settings" are selected in the control panel, subsequent overlay sends will 
appear to send as normal even though they (correctly) are not then in effect.

- Fixed a bug where using a Go To Level command in an overlay or group without
an overlay to match the level number could cause IntelliKeys USB to freeze.
