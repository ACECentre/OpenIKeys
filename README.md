# OpenIKeys
An Open Source driver for the IntelliKeys AT Keyboard

This repository holds the original IntelliKeys driver software as released by Ablenet in October, 2017.

The "original" directly holds the raw files as extracted from the Zip file that was released.  Because it's clear that there are many duplicated files and we will have to restructure this repository, I (Bill) felt it important to keep a raw copy.
